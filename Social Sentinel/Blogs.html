                WHAT WE DID                                                                                                             Online social networks are frequently targeted by malicious actors who create fake accounts for the purpose of carrying out abuse. Broadly, abuse is conducted in three phases. First, malicious actors create accounts. Then, these accounts need to establish connections with real users (e.g., by sending friend requests on Facebook). Finally, once they establish a sufficient number of connections, fake accounts can expose their social networks to a variety of malicious activities and abuse.
                Online social networks are frequently targeted by malicious actors who 
                create fake accounts for the purpose of carrying out abuse. Broadly, 
                abuse is conducted in three phases. First, malicious actors create 
                accounts. Then, these accounts need to establish connections with real 
                users. Finally, once they establish a sufficient number of connections, 
                fake accounts can expose their social networks to a variety of malicious 
                activities and abuse.

                In our web, “:Social Sentinel graph-based early detection of fake accounts 
                on social networks,” we focus on the detection of new fake accounts that 
                manage to evade registration-time classifiers but have not yet made sufficient 
                connections to perpetrate abuse. This means that we target accounts that manage 
                to circumvent defenses that target new accounts immediately when they are created,
                using a suspicious email or IP address. In this work, we aim to identify such 
                accounts that are at the early stages of their activity on the platform, 
                potentially before abuse has been manifested. By detecting fake accounts early, 
                we mitigate their ability to launch abuse against other users. 

                    
              The proliferation of social media platforms has transformed the way individuals communicate and share information. However, this unprecedented connectivity has also given rise to the widespread creation of fake social media profiles, leading to various issues such as misinformation, identity theft, cyberbullying, and fraud. In response to this challenge, our project, "Fake Social Media Profile Detection and Reporting," aims to develop an innovative solution to detect and report fake profiles on popular social media networks.

Our approach leverages a combination of machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to identify suspicious patterns and characteristics in user profiles. We analyze various data points, including profile pictures, follower count, post count. We aim to improve the accuracy of our system in identifying fake 
  profiles.
